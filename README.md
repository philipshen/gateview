# Gateview

Share access without sharing passwords.

## Problem

Be honest: have you ever seen a password like "CompanyName123!" at work to
access a seemingly important function?  Have you created a similarly simple
password for a personal account because you just couldn't be bothered?

There's been an
[explosion](https://blog.acrossapp.com/how-a-2-person-startup-already-uses-28-other-tools/)
in the quality and quantity of off-the-shelf software companies use to
run and scale quickly: GitHub, Airtable, Hubspot, Figma, Slack, Twitter,
Instagram, oh my!

For each of these services, there's an accompanying set of credentials that are
either shared with the team or are up to each employee to manage on their own.
Both of these options come with tradeoffs in time costs and vulnerabilities that
we don't believe should exist in 2020.

## Solution

Gateview is the simplest and most secure way for teams to access the web apps
that they use. Teams can log in to accounts on Twitter, Slack, and Heroku
without typing a username and password, ensure that their information is kept tightly
controlled and secured, and onboard and offboard employees in one click.
